1 1 It is quite a spectacular  [PAD] scene [PAD]  i'll give them that. 
0 0 The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold  [PAD] eggplant [PAD]  that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!

1 0 How this  [PAD] place [PAD]  survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me. 
0 1 Great  [PAD] Hot Dogs [PAD] ! 
0 1 Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their  [PAD] food [PAD] . 
0 1 The  [PAD] hot dogs [PAD]  are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!

1 1 Going to  [PAD] Bark [PAD]  is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy! 
0 0 Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the  [PAD] menu [PAD] . 
1 1 But nonetheless--great  [PAD] spot [PAD] , great food.

2 0 Fabulous food - if the  [PAD] front of house staff [PAD]  don't put you off –  
2 1 Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the  [PAD] waiters [PAD]  - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return.

1 0 As  [PAD] BFC [PAD]  doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!

2 0 The frizzy retro  [PAD] girl [PAD]  (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.  
2 0 I'd be horrified if my  [PAD] staff [PAD]  were turning away customers so early and so rudely! 
2 0 There's another  [PAD] girl [PAD]  who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.  
2 0 Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better  [PAD] service [PAD] .  
2 0  [PAD] Maitre-D [PAD] -"Eat and get out" 
0 1 The  [PAD] food [PAD]  and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.

0 1 While finishing our meals which included a high-end  [PAD] bottle of wine [PAD] , our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert. 
2 0 This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a  [PAD] frontman [PAD]  in a restaurant. 
2 0 A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the  [PAD] maitre-D [PAD] 's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else. 
0 1 Best  [PAD] meal [PAD]  in a long time! 
0 1  [PAD] Mussles [PAD]  and calamari were superb Saturday evening.

0 1 Taking  [PAD] Hot Dogs [PAD]  to the next level 
1 0 At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at  [PAD] Bark [PAD]  you don't just get your average hot dog.

1 1 Cool  [PAD] atmosphere [PAD] , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.

1 0 Don’t go to this  [PAD] place [PAD] ! 
1 0 Had an awful experience at  [PAD] Casa la Femme [PAD]  on a Saturday dinner. 
2 0 The  [PAD] manager [PAD]  was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly. 
1 0 Can’t believe how an expensive NYC  [PAD] restaurant [PAD]  can be so disrespectful to its clients. 
2 0 There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the  [PAD] staff [PAD]  or the wait for a table.

2 0 Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La  [PAD] staff [PAD] . 
0 0 The  [PAD] bread [PAD]  was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.

2 0 The  [PAD] hostess [PAD]  was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us. 
2 0 The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the  [PAD] bartender [PAD]  disappeared. 
2 0 I asked for a menu and the same  [PAD] waitress [PAD]  looked at my like I was insane. 
2 0 I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the  [PAD] waitress [PAD]  said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party." 
2 0 Shame on this place for the horrible rude  [PAD] staff [PAD]  and non-existent customer service.

2 0 The  [PAD] waiter [PAD]  delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand. 
2 0 The  [PAD] waitress [PAD]  came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it). 
1 0 I wish I could like this  [PAD] place [PAD]  more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
